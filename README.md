This is our attempt at designing an autonomous system that can safely operate a 7-DOF Sawyer robot arm and assist a human in clearing a table top. This project is a part of the course CSCI 7000 - Algorithmic Human Robot Interaction that we took with Professor Bradley Hayes in Spring 2020 at CU Boulder.
